The \"goal\" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.\n\n### Attribute Information:\n\nIt's a clean, easy to understand set of data. However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,\n\n1. age: The person's age in years\n1. sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n1. cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n1. trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n1. chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\n1. fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)\n1. restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n1. thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved\n1. exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n1. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)\n1. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n1. ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)\n1. thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)\n1. target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)\n### Acknowledgements\n#### Creators:\n\n1.

The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124](1), ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests [https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/heart-health-education/Medical-tests-for-heart-disease](2). Looking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking [https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors](3) . According to another source [https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack](4), the major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**. Note that **thalassemia**, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: **Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes**.
